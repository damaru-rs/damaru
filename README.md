# Damaru [WIP]

It's a rust-based browser-oriented front-end framework with high download speed and high performance.
Damaru has small components for browser and has high performance of rust. 
It can be an alternative to javascript front-end frameworks.


## Motivation

All front-end frameworks have very big size after building. Package weights more than MB, even if pages are very small
because of this, we shouldn't build and pack application in one big package. This problem doesn't allow to write rust 
front-end for low internet speed.
